What's new
==========

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

 * StreamField required status is now consistently handled by the ``blank`` keyword argument (Matt Westcott)
 * Show 'required' asterisks for blocks inside required StreamFields (Matt Westcott)


Upgrade considerations
======================

Updated handling of non-required StreamFields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rules for determining whether a StreamField is required (i.e. at least one block must be provided) have been simplified and made consistent with other field types. Non-required fields are now indicated by ``blank=True`` on the ``StreamField`` definition; the default is ``blank=False`` (the field is required). In previous versions, to make a field non-required, it was necessary to define :ref:`a top-level StreamBlock<streamfield_top_level_streamblock>` with ``required=False`` (which applied the validation rule) as well as setting ``blank=True`` (which removed the asterisk from the form field). You should review your use of StreamField to check that ``blank=True`` is used on the fields you wish to make optional.
